The different status types are an extension of the [EARL](https://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10-Schema/) vocabulary where the nextended terms can be found in the [olivaw-earl dataset](https://github.com/Wimmics/olivaw/blob/main/olivaw/test/olivaw-earl.ttl), each outcome type means:
* :boom: MajorFail: This is an error that is critical and consider as blocking for production
* :exclamation: MinorFail: This is an error that should be fixed, but it is cannot be considered as critical error
* :warning: CannotTell: It is unclear if the subject passed or failed the test. This happens when an automated test requires human judgement to make a definite decision.
* :grey_question: NotTested:  The test has not been carried out. Here this is because a previous test that was mandatory to be passed did not end up as Pass.
* :white_check_mark: Pass: The subject passed the test.
